You may want to access your site without having 'wiki.php' appear in your
address. There are two ways to accomplish your want.

First, if you have root privilage to configure your web server(apache),
simply add the following lines to your apache conf.

  Alias /mywiki /path/to/wiki.php

If you don't have a access permission to configure your web server,
do the following workaround.

Make a simple php script with no .php extension.
------------- mywiki ------------
<?php
// chdir("/path/to/moniwiki");
include("wiki.php"); 
?>
-------------- 8X ---------------

Then, add the following lines to the .htaccess file in the same directory 
as the 'mywiki' file (create the .htaccess file if doesn't exist):

-- .htaccess for Apache 1.3.xx --
<Files mywiki>
SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</Files>

-- .htaccess for Apache 2.0.xx --
<Files mywiki>
ForceType application/x-httpd-php
</Files>
------------- 8X ----------------

This tells the apache webserver to treat the 'mywiki' file as a PHP script
even though it doesn't have a .php extension.
