=== The first subsection ===
Here is a link to the page titled: BizarStructuredText 

And here is another line of text.  Incidentally, you might want to do one
of the following:
 1. Brush your teeth.
 2. Visit: ProposedWork
If not, then just sit back, [[relax]], and [[enjoy]] the flight.

=== Can You Believe There's a Second Subsection? ===
They were surprised about the first subsection on this page.  Imagine the complete astonishment when they discovered that there was a ''second'' subsection!  An important part of this section is its reference to the MissionStatement.  Be ''sure'' to check it out.

||||||'''A Very Important Table'''||
||'''x-val'''||'''y-val'''||'''z-val'''||
||32.6||18.3||21.75||
||34.9||17.l||23.6||
 
== What to Do When You're Getting Bored with the First Section ==
Here are several possibilities:
 1. Play hopscotch.
 1. Check for loose change in the sofa cushions.
 1. Clip your fingernails.
 1. Change your socks.
 1. Have another beer.
 1. Check out, http://www.halfbakery.com, for instance http://www.halfbakery.com/idea/Jehovah_27s_20Witness_20Delivery#979686222-5-1
 1. Go right ahead and read the Second Section.

'''''Please Note:''''' ''There has been considerable controversy about several of the above listed alternatives to reading the First Section.  Some people think they are silly.  Some people think they are offensive.  And some people just think that they are a waste of time.  All of these may be true.  However, we stand by them, as we firmly believe that they are '''all''' more interesting than the First Section.''
